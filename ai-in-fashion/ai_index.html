        <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.</p>

        <h1>What is Machine Learning?</h1>
        <p>Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.</p>

        <h2>Artificial Intelligence in Fashion</h2>
        <p>Increasingly, fashion brands are using AI and machine learning to maximize usersâ€™ shopping experience, improve the efficiency of sales systems through intelligent automation, and enhance the sales processes using predictive analytics and guided sales processes.</p>

        <p>Fashion brands are also starting to leverage conversational assistants through chatbots and voice assistant devices such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Home, and Microsoft Cortana.</p>

        <p>In addition to conversational systems, AI is making its way into ecommerce and mobile apps. Customers are now able to take pictures of clothing they like or styles they want to imitate, and smart image recognition systems can match the photos to real life items available for sale. Additionally, AI-enabled shopping apps allow customers to take screenshots of clothes they see online, identify shoppable apparels and accessories in that photo, and then find the same outfit and shop for similar styles.</p>
